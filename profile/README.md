# Marmot Labs

**Marmot Labs** builds practical, engineering-driven solutions for privacy, data protection, and regulatory compliance.

We focus on helping teams move privacy out of static documentation and into day-to-day engineering workflows — where systems actually change, data actually flows, and risk actually accumulates.

## What we do

- **Privacy engineering & architecture**
  - Privacy-by-design and privacy-by-default system design
  - Data flow modeling, minimization, and purpose limitation
  - Secure and auditable data handling patterns

- **Developer-centric privacy tooling**
  - Automated detection of data flows and processing changes
  - Drift detection between documented intent and implemented code
  - Tooling that fits naturally into CI/CD and code review workflows

- **Compliance enablement**
  - GDPR, ISO-27701, and modern privacy risk frameworks
  - Practical support for DPIAs/PIAs, RoPA, and ongoing reassessment
  - Bridging legal requirements with engineering reality

## Technology

Our solutions are technology-agnostic, but we have deep experience with:
- Elixir & Phoenix
- Cloud-native architectures (AWS)
- Data pipelines and event-driven systems
- Modern web and API platforms

## Open source

This organization hosts open-source projects related to privacy engineering, compliance automation, and developer tooling.

Some repositories may be experimental or exploratory — feedback and collaboration are welcome.
